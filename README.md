# mysensors-bbq-thermometer
This is a mysensors-enabled bbq thermometer using an IKEA FANTAST probe.

You might have to calibrate the a,b,c parameters in the sketch for your probe if the temperature values are way off, 
see https://blognamn.wordpress.com/2018/08/10/mysensors-capable-bbq-thermometer/ for details on the design.
